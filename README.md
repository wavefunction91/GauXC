# Synopsis

GauXC is a modern, modular C++ library for the evaluation of quantities related
to the exchange-correlation (XC) energy (e.g. potential, etc) in the Gaussian
basis set discretization of Kohn-Sham density function theory (KS-DFT). GauXC
provides efficient, scalable distributed memory XC integrators for both CPU and
accelerator-based (GPU) architectures. Currently, GPU support is provided through
the [CUDA](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html)
framework and is only accessible to NVIDIA GPUs. However, work is underway to
provide portable interfaces to these implementations as to allow for use with
emerging exascale and post-exascale compute resources (See e.g. PRs for
[SYCL/DPC++](https://github.com/wavefunction91/GauXC/pull/4) and 
[HIP](https://github.com/wavefunction91/GauXC/pull/5) ports of GauXC). Evaluation
of the XC functional CPU/accelerator architectures is provided by the
[ExchCXX](https://github.com/wavefunction91/ExchCXX) library. Quadratures generated
by the [IntegratorXX](https://github.com/wavefunction91/IntegratorXX).

GauXC is a work in progress. Its development has been funded by the U.S.
Department of Energy Exascale Computing Project 
([NWChemEx](https://github.com/NWChemEx-Project)).


# Design Goals

* Provide a stable, portable and high-performance implementation of numerical
integrators optimized for the evaluation of XC related quantities in Gaussian
basis set KS-DFT on CPU and accelerator based architectures.
* Develop a modern, modular, extensible C++ software infrastructure which allows
for flexible and agile development in the field of KS-DFT.

# Build Instructions

GauXC provides a CMake build system with automatic dependency management (through [FetchContent](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FetchContent.html)).
As such, a simple CMake invocation will often suffice for most purposes
```
cmake -H/path/to/gauxc -B/path/to/build [GauXC configure options]
cmake --build /path/to/build
```

Currently, GauXC is not installable as a separate library (Coming Soon). GauXC may be integrated 
into existing CMake projects via `FetchContent` with the following
```
include(FetchContent)

set( GAUXC_ENABLE_TESTS OFF CACHE BOOL "Disable GauXC Tests" )
# Other GauXC Options (see below)

FetchContent_Declare( gauxc GIT_REPOSITORY https://github/com/wavefunction91/GauXC.git GIT_TAG master )
FetchContent_MakeAvailable( gauxc )


# Create my_target
target_link_libraries( my_target PUBLIC gauxc )
```
