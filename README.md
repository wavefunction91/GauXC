# Synopsis

GauXC is a modern, modular C++ library for the evaluation of quantities related
to the exchange-correlation (XC) and exact-exchange (K) energy (e.g. potential, etc) in the Gaussian
basis set discretization of Kohn-Sham density function theory (KS-DFT). GauXC
provides efficient, scalable distributed memory XC and K integrators for both CPU and
accelerator-based (GPU) architectures. Currently, GPU support is provided through
the
[CUDA](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html) and
[HIP](https://rocmdocs.amd.com/en/latest/Programming_Guides/HIP-GUIDE.html)
frameworks to target NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, respectively.
Evaluation
of the XC functional CPU/accelerator architectures is provided by the
[ExchCXX](https://github.com/wavefunction91/ExchCXX) library. Quadratures are generated
by the [IntegratorXX](https://github.com/wavefunction91/IntegratorXX).

GauXC is a work in progress. Its development has been funded by the U.S.
Department of Energy Exascale Computing Project
([NWChemEx](https://github.com/NWChemEx-Project)).


# Design Goals

* Provide a stable, portable and high-performance implementation of numerical
integrators optimized for the evaluation of XC and K related quantities in Gaussian
basis set KS-DFT on CPU and accelerator based architectures.

for flexible and agile development in the field of KS-DFT.
